# DanhengServer-WebGM

## Features
- Pure HTML implementation
- All requests are done on the client side, you can use static hosting services such as GH Pages for deployment.
- Strictly follows the DanhengServer MUIP API.
- Nice interface with carded UI and blurred background, supports auto dark mode, wallpaper can be switched by dark mode.

## Weaknesses
- Your DanhengServer MUIP AdminKey is stored explicitly and can be viewed by users.
- Just output the JSON information returned by the API without user-friendly formatting.

## Deployment
1. Clone this repository, or copy index.html to any web server.
2. Modify lines 165 and 166 in index.html to your own DanhengServer Dispatch address and MUIP key.
3. Finish. Enjoy! (You can also change the page title to your own server name, but please don't remove the link to this GitHub Repo!!!QwQ)

## Planned improvements
- Adding links to the GitHub Repo and my website
- Demonstrate user-friendly tabular responses
- Load DanhengServer Handbook to get names corresponding to (roles, tasks, etc.) IDs
- i18n support
